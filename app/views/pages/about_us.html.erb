					<h2 class="test1">"Prior to contacting Hanning I tried three other recruitment agencies over the course of 3 months with no luck. After meeting Toby I immediately felt comfortable and relaxed knowing that my voice was being heard and my best interests were their priority. Within 3 weeks of the first meeting I was placed in my current role which I hugely enjoy within a company I hope to remain at for the foreseeable future." <br></br><span>– Candidate</span></h2>
